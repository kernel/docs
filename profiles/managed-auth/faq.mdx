## How does automatic re-authentication work?

When you link credentials to a connection, Kernel monitors the login session and re-authenticates automatically when it expires. Periodic health checks detect logged-out sessions and trigger re-auth in the background, so the profile stays logged in without additional action on your part.

<Warning>
Automatic re-authentication only works when the stored credentials are complete and don't require human input. If login needs SMS/email OTP, push notifications, or manual MFA selection, you'll need to trigger a new login session manually.
</Warning>


## How often are health checks performed?

Health checks on regular cadences based on your plan:
- Hobbyist (1 hr)
- Start-Up (15 min)
- Enterprise (configurable)

## How do I know if a Kernel can automatically re-authenticate a connection?

Check the `can_reauth` field on a connection. This boolean checks the following conditions:

1. **Credential linked** — A credential must be attached to the connection (stored in Kernel or via an external provider like [1Password](/integrations/1password))
2. **No external action required** — The learned login flow doesn't require human intervention

Only if all of the above conditions are met will `can_reauth` be `true`. When true, Kernel will attempt to automatically re-authenticate the connection.

### External actions that prevent auto-reauth

After a successful login, Kernel saves the login flow. If the flow includes steps that require human action—like SMS/email OTP, push notifications, or manual MFA selection—Kernel marks the connection as unable to auto-reauth because those steps can't be automated without user input.

If your login flow requires one of these, you can still automate around it:
- **Switch to TOTP** — If the site supports authenticator apps, add a `totp_secret` to your credential. TOTP codes are generated automatically, so the login flow won't require external action.
- **Trigger manual re-auth** — Start a new login session and route the user through the [Hosted UI](/profiles/managed-auth/hosted-ui) or [Programmatic](/profiles/managed-auth/programmatic) flow.

## Which authentication methods are supported?

Managed Auth supports username/password authentication and most SSO providers. 

<Warning>
Passkey-based authentication (e.g., Google accounts with passkeys enabled) is not currently supported. If a user's SSO provider requires a passkey, the login will fail.
</Warning>

## What happens if login fails?

If a login attempt fails, Kernel will retry with exponential backoff. After multiple failures, the [login flow](/profiles/managed-auth/hosted-ui) will be marked as failed and you'll receive an error. Common failure reasons include:

- Invalid credentials
- Bot detection blocking the login page
- CAPTCHAs that couldn't be solved

## Can I use Managed Auth with any website?

Managed Auth works with most websites. Sites with aggressive bot detection may require additional configuration (stealth mode, proxies). Passkeys and hardware security keys are not currently supported.

## How is Managed Auth billed?

Managed Auth is included on all paid plans with no per-connection fees. It uses browser sessions to log in and keep your sessions fresh—these count toward your browser usage like any other browser session.

Auth sessions are fast (typically 5-30 seconds each). Kernel monitors session health and re-authenticates automatically when sessions expire—most stay valid for days. For example, keeping 100 auth connections logged in typically costs less than $5/month in browser usage. See [Pricing & Limits](/info/pricing#managed-auth) for details.
