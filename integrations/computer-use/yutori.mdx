[n1](https://yutori.com/blog/introducing-n1) is Yutori's pixels-to-actions LLM that predicts browser actions from screenshots. This computer use model enables AI agents to interact with web interfaces by analyzing visual content and generating appropriate mouse and keyboard actions.

By integrating Yutori n1 with Kernel, you can run these AI-powered browser automations on cloud-hosted infrastructure, eliminating the need for local browser management and enabling scalable, reliable AI agents.

## Quick setup with our Yutori example app

Get started quickly with our Kernel app template that includes a pre-configured Yutori n1 integration:

```bash
kernel create --name my-yutori-app --template yutori-computer-use
```

Choose `TypeScript` or `Python` as the programming language.

Then follow the [Quickstart guide](/quickstart/) to deploy and run your Yutori automation on Kernel's infrastructure.

## Benefits of using Kernel with Yutori n1

- **No local browser management**: Run n1 automations without installing or maintaining browsers locally
- **Scalability**: Launch multiple browser sessions in parallel for concurrent AI agents
- **Stealth mode**: Built-in anti-detection features for reliable web interactions
- **Session state**: Maintain browser state across runs via [Profiles](/profiles/overview)
- **Live view**: Debug your Yutori agents with real-time browser viewing
- **Cloud infrastructure**: Run computationally intensive AI agents without local resource constraints
